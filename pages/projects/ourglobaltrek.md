text: "A personal travel blog that details my adventures around the globe. It was originally launched with a custom Wordpress theme that I later changed to React. The front end is rendered with <a class='link' href='https://nextjs.org/' target='__blank'>Next.js</a> and data is fetched from Wordpress as a Headless CMS using GraphQL."
