heading: "Hi, my name is Carlos. \n Nice to meet you."
text: "I'm a self-taught software developer, currently volunteering for a non-profit while looking for my next full-time opportunity. I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree and am passionate about using technology to revolutionize traditional industries through automation and digitization. Previously, I was the CEO of an imports and exports company in Brazil where I restructured operations that led to multimillion dollar profits.

Besides technology, I've been to 65+ countries, all 7 continents and I love exploring new cultures and cuisines. Along the way, I discovered photography as a means to express my view of the world.
