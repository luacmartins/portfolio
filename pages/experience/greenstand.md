text: "Greenstand's mission is to fight climate change and alleviate poverty. I am currently working on the admin panel tool to help our users track and manage the trees they plant. So far, I have implemented an image optimization solution to speed up page load time and have also contributed to the tree capture matching tool, reducing the need for manual tree matching work."
