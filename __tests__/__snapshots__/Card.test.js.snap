    Hadar is an imports and exports company supplying the textile industry in Brazil. I joined the struggling company in 2011 and during my time as CEO, I was able to restructure all of its operations from product lines and suppliers to logistics and fulfillment partners. I also secured $300k in funding for the growing operations of the company. These changes led the company to an upswing, getting out of the red and reporting over $1.5m in revenue and 28% net profit in the first year. In the following years, I was responsible for bringing 420+ clients and adding 7 new product lines. I left the company in 2019 to pursue my passion in technology.
